# NB-IOT_tracking_device

This NB-IoT tracking device will be used primarily to track small belongings like bags, pets, backpacks, briefcases, etc.  It will provide real-time GPS coordinates to a cell tower which will transmit back to a server.  The client application will communicate with the server in real-time to constantly update GPS coordinates.  This application will have a readable GUI so that users can easily interpret the GPS coordinates.
